# Integrating with GitHub

This repository contains short utility scripts that make it easy to connect codePost with GitHub.

A typical weekly workflow involving GitHub and codePost might look something like this:

- Students submit their submissions to GitHub
- After the assignment deadline, lead instructor imports submissions into codePost from GitHub
- Student submissions are graded and reviewed in codePost
- Students access their feedback and scores on in codePost

## Import submissions into codePost from GitHub

codePost supports three different GitHub configutations. Select the one that applies to your course and follow the corresponding instructions.
